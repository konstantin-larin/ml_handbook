# What is this repository about?

I used the [ML textbook from Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://education.yandex.ru/handbook/ml/) as the foundation for studying Machine Learning.
After reading one or more chapters, I came up with practical cases to reinforce the material â€” each of them is presented in this repository.

Additionally, this repository contains my personal notebooks following tutorials from:
- [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
